        <h2>🐾 About Us</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Pawfect Match – where love finds a home.

            We're a passionate team of animal lovers on a mission to connect kind-hearted people with pets in need of a second chance. Founded in 2024, our platform makes it easier than ever to find, adopt, and care for your new furry friend.
            
            Whether you're looking for a playful pup, a gentle senior cat, or anything in between, we work closely with local shelters and rescue organizations to ensure every pet gets the home they deserve.

        <p>
            We provide a simple, friendly way to browse available pets, learn their stories, and apply for adoption — all in one place. We also offer helpful resources for first-time pet parents, including care guides, FAQs, and post-adoption support.

        <h2>👋 Meet the Team</h2>
        <p>
            We’re a small group of volunteers, developers, and pet advocates who came together with one goal: to help animals find loving homes. Some of us are adopters, some are shelter workers, but we all share a love for four-legged friends.
